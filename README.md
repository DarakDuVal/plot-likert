Plot Likert
===========
This is a library to visualize results from [Likert-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) survey questions in Python, using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

It's inspired by Jason Bryer's great [`likert` package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/likert/), but nowhere near as good.

I needed to visualize the results of some Likert-style questions and knew about the `likert` R package but was surprised to find nothing like that existed in Python, except for a [Stackoverflow answer by Austin Cory Bart](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41384812). This package builds on that solution and packages it as a library.

I've since discovered that there may be other solutions out there.
Here are a few to consider:
- https://github.com/dmardanbeigi/Likert_Scale_Plot_in_Python
- https://github.com/Oliph/likertScalePlot
- https://blog.orikami.nl/behind-the-screens-likert-scale-visualization-368557ad72d1

At this stage, it can best be considered a quick-and-dirty hack and lacks a lot of features that would be nice to have.
(But it's been getting a lot better thanks to the contributions of a number of community members and [Fjoh√ºrs Lykkewe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef7cTuVUiWs)!)
